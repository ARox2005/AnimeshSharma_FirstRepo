My One Week Experience at IITP :
When I saw the Main Gate of the campus I was amazed to see its design. It was constructed in a way that it looked like IITP
written there.
Then I entered the campus and saw that BIG main Building and was amazed to it.
after that the orientation continued and it was just plain Experience, Nothing Special.
The one thing I enjoyed very much was pronight.
